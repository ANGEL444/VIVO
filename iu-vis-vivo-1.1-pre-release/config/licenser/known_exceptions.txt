#
# A list of files and directories that are known exceptions to the 
# license-insertion process.
#
# Files will only be altered if they contain a "magic" license place-holder, 
# but if they match one of the file-matchers and don't contain a place-holder,
# the process will write a warning.
#
# File-matchers are:
# '*.java', '*.jsp', '*.tld', '*.xsl', '*.xslt', '*.css', '*.js', 'build.xml'
#
# Known exceptions listed here produce no warnings.
#

# PROBLEM: It appears that these files require a LICENSE file to accompany them.

# PROBLEM: This is from www.involutionstudios.com, not blueprint. What are the license restrictions?
