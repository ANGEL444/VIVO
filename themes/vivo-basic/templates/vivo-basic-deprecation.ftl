   <h1>The vivo-basic theme has been deprecated with the 1.2 release and is not recommended for production instances.</h1>

   <p>Since vivo-basic was the default theme for all previous releases, it is included as part of VIVO 1.2 to help with the transition of upgrading existing installations to the latest code, but all vivo-basic development has ceased and it will not be distributed in future releases.</p>

   <p>Please note that vivo-basic does not support all of the new 1.2 features. Most notably, in choosing to use vivo-basic you will be missing out on the following:</p>

   <ul>
       <li>new primary menu for site navigation (replaces tabs)</li>
       <li>home page with class group browse and visual graph</li>
       <li>menu pages with class group and individual browse</li>
   </ul>

   <p>The new default theme shipped with the application is called <strong>wilma</strong> and fully supports all 1.2 features. For details on how to create a custom theme using wilma as a starting point, please review the <a href="http://www.vivoweb.org/support/user-guide/administration" title="Download VIVO documentation" target="_blank">Site Administrator's Guide</a>. You can select your active theme on the site information page, located at <em>Site Admin > Site Information</em>.</p>
